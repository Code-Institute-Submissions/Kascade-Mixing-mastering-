this site is for users in a potentially up an coming band/artist looking 
to record their ideas and have them professionally mixed and mastered.
they may have a look at the previous work the producer has done and a way to contact him.




iframe link bug, cant get the video to play through the index page. could be a copyright issue. i couldnt find the right informtation.



place holder text still on main page. this site is for a friend trying to start doing mixing/mastering professionally. unfortunaly i have been waiting for his word
on what to put on the front page as a description of what he does etc etc. for now it is taken up my placeholder text until he decides what he would like it to say.


Still no links for YOUTUBE, LINKDIN and INSTAGRAM. 

struggling to get site to resize on different platforms.
