      <p>My passion for music truly ignited in the first year of secondary school when my friends showed me Slipknot- it wasn’t long before I developed an insatiable thirst for heavy and technical music.
For the remainder of my years in education I developed my skills as both a musician and a recording engineer, spending the vast majority of my time dabbling in demo-making, live sound engineering, synthesiser programming, exploring genres and instruments, and of course learning the industry ropes in various local bands and projects. 
By 2016 I had a good skill set and toolset that enabled me to be able to take my production more seriously. I wrote, recorded, mixed and mastered my band ‘Bound In Fear’s debut song ‘Deceit’, which came out in July of 2016 and marked my debut as a professional producer. My first clients were an ACM metal band called ‘Inner Eclipse’  their single came out May 17th 2017. The band had intended to go to a professional studio for their album but were so impressed with my work they decided to hire me- the band broke up and reformed several times before the founding member re-hired me to produce his new bands debut EP (‘Sunfall - Serenity’) 3 years later, which still had fragments of the original album I was hired to work on. Bound In Fear’s debut EP was released in April 2017, which marked the first full release I had completed. That year I also started working for ‘Pig Squeals And Breakdowns’, a death metal review website, and ‘Chugcore’, an underground independent label and promotion company primarily based in America. This meant that by September 2017 I was juggling some serious  responsibilities and taking on some great opportunities. Some of these include: reviewing major releases in the Slam and Deathcore scene, talent scouting, negotiating promotion and distribution terms with bands, handling YouTube premieres and running the channel, running Facebook posts and promotions, recording mixing and mastering bands and performing regularly.
In November 2017 Bound In Fear embarked on their first tour, which was a 5 date run starting in Luxembourg and finishing in Manchester at the FITBII festival. It was at this point we caught the eye of the label ‘Unique Leader Records’. We spent the next 14 months expanding our brand and negotiating a potential deal with their CEO Jamie Graham. During this time I had accomplished multiple production milestones including conquering live drums, some of my mixes achieving a 6 figure view count on YouTube, picking up label work and earning enough to cover the bills.
In January 2019 Bound In Fear signed a deal with Unique Leader Records and began work on ’The Hand Of Violence’. I was incredibly proud to have been given the trust and responsibility to be placed in a studio for 30 days and turn our 4 demos into a fully polished 10 track album. I found the process to be the most enjoyable period of my life. From it I learned a colossal amount- Other than using programmed drums, every aspect of the album was recorded as naturally as possible in order for me to have the freedom and control to really shape the album, although it came with many challenges.
In January 2020 I decided to leave the band to focus on my production career. I am now involved in various exciting internet projects, as well as ghost writing for a signed artist. I am also in the process of expanding my company.</p>
